{{< project id="cat" name="A Cat in Time" apps="Unity, Blender, Musik">}}
Mobilegame for the [City Museum Tübingen](https://www.tuebingen.de/stadtmuseum/) (still in development). To save the ghost of the cat mummy we travel to the year 1607. The player must solve a puzzle in each of four different historical museum rooms. Here I was responsible for 3D models and texturing, as well as music. The soundtrack has the special gimmic that the instruments change during the time shift.
