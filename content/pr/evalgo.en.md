Evalgo is a course management system for students and lecturers that was developed for the course *Current Developments in Online Media* by Prof. Dirk Eisenbiegler on the topic *Evaluation of Go for Web Development*.<br><br>.
Instructors and tutors can write assignments using Markdown formatting and students can submit them. On the main page, the assignment, as well as the submissions of all students to the selected assignment can be found. Depending on the configuration, the latter are visible to all users or only to authorized users (lecturer or tutor).
