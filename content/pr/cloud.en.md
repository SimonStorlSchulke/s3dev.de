In my bachelor thesis I dealt with the **procedural generation of clouds in offline render engines**. The focus was on user-friendliness. With the help of a few parameters it should be possible to create complex cloud shapes. The prototype was implemented in Blender with its real-time render engine Eevee. The implementation was then done with OSL (Open Shading Language) and tested with the Cycles render engine.
