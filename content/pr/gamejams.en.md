{{< project id="gamejams" name="GameJams" apps="Unity, Godot, Blender, FL-Studio">}}

I participated in several GameJams during my studies. I took different roles - sometimes I was responsible for code, sometimes for 3D models and sometimes for music. So I was able to expand my knowledge in all areas and learn to work under strong time pressure in a team.

[**Don't Lose a Beat**](https://github.com/CalvinDO/DontLoseABeat) Bring a disharmonic orchestra back to the right beat and pitch. Here I provided 3D models, music and helped with the programming. The project was created during the GlobalGamejam 2021 within five days. The scope was of course much too big for the short time frame and since I was responsible for all models, animations and music, as well as helping out with the programming, the playability of the result is quite limited. Nevertheless, we had a lot of positive stress and fun with it.
