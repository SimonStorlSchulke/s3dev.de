Hi I'm Simon. I do stuff with media and computers. I studied Computer Science in Media at Furtwangen University, which gave me a good foundation in many areas of media production and computer science to build upon. My focus during my studies was mainly on CGI, VFX and game development.

After being active as a tutor in computer graphics for a long time during my studies, I now teach the lecture "Data Processing in Media Production" at the HS Furtwangen.

Beyond that, I make a lot of music and have two wonderful dogs that I roam the Black Forest with.
