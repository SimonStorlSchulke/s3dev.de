**F**urtwangen **U**niversity **D**idactic **G**ame **E**ditor is a TypeScript based Game Engine designed with educationin mind by Prof. Jirka Dell'Oro-Friel. I worked on the implementation of mesh generation, OBJ mesh import and shaders. In the <a href="https://github.com/hs-furtwangen/FUDGE-Chemistry_MasterW19">Chemistry with FUDGE <i class="fab fa-github fa-gh"></i></a> project, we used the engine at a very early stage to implement an [atomic orbital construction kit](https://hs-furtwangen.github.io/FUDGE-Chemistry_MasterW19/app/tutor.html).

Evalgo is a course management system for students and instructors that was developed for the course *Current Developments in Online Media* by Prof. Dirk Eisenbiegler on the topic Evaluation of Go for Web Development.

Instructors and tutors can write assignments and students can submit them.

Feedback and grades can be given by instructors on the submissions, which appear in an overview and grade table for authorized users.

<p class="describer-right">Go, OpenGL</p>

For the course *Real-Time Computer Graphics* by Rainer Duda I developed a demo about procedural textures and fractals using Go and OpenGL.

<p class="describer-right">OSL, Blender</p>

In my bachelor thesis I dealt with the **procedural generation of clouds in offline render engines**. The focus was on usability. With the help of a few parameters it should be possible to implement complex cloud shapes. The implementation was done with OSL (Open Shading Language).

<h2 id="cat"> A Cat in Time</h2>
<p class="describer-right">Unity, Blender</p>

Mobilegame for the [City Museum Tübingen](https://www.tuebingen.de/stadtmuseum/) (still in development). To save the ghost of the cat mummy we travel to the year 1607. Here I was responsible for 3D models and texturing, as well as music. The soundtrack has the special gimmic that the instruments change during the time shift.

3D Scanning by drone and remodeling of the old SABA Farbik site in the Villingen Innovation Park in cooperation with Andreas Reich, Linus Ehmann and Sophie Tobisch. 

Among other things, I was responsible for the remodeling of the SABA main building based on the scanned data and references.

<h2 id="gamejams"> GameJams</h2>
<p class="describer-right">Unity, Godot, Blender, FL-Studio</p>

I participated in several GameJams during my studies. I took different roles - sometimes I was responsible for code, sometimes for 3D models and sometimes for music. So I was able to expand my knowledge in all areas and learn to work under strong time pressure in a team.
